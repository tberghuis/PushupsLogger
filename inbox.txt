just stick with the view intent
have a delay, update DB and show a snackbar

cull old trello boards (pushups)

workmanager codelab,
sln, run a single job that can update db and display a toast, 
or run a slice which shows daily total

i think slice is the solution

got it to work

log X push-ups in "APP NAME"

alternatives

open "APP NAME" and log X push-ups

is there a way to have a shortcut just run a job, without intent show UI, or just show a toast or snackbar
workmanager codelab or alarmmanager...
